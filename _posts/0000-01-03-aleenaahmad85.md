Facebook was started on February 4, 2004 by Mark Zackerberg in his Harvard dorm room. 
I personally remember leaving my MySpace page to open a Facebook profile because I saw all my friends telling me they don't use MySpace anymore. At that time, it was interesting to open a Facebook account because it was it was very simple and easy. 
Now Facebook has now other networking products such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Marketplace.
