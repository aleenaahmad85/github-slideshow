MySpace was an American social networking website which was founded on August 1, 2003. It was the largest networking website from 2005 to 2008. I personally remember using MySpace, changing the background and keeping my page up to date with the latest music in the background. It was like a challenge to make sure that you have the coolest page out of all your friends.
