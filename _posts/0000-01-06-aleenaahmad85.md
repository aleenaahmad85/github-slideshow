Discord was founded May 13, 2015 and is an instant message social media software mostly used by the gaming community for mobile gamers, but expanded to businesses and education. Discord uses channels in which users can get involved in but also have friends in which they can privately chat. 
Personally, I had never heard of Discord until I started at NIU and all my class fellows and my Discover code_orange internship also utilized Discord as a way of communication.
