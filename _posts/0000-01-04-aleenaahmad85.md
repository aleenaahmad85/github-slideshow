title: "Instagram"

Instagram was launched on October 6, 2010, which was a different way of social media, sharing your videos and pictures and location.
The idea was brought to Kevin Systrom due to the wide growth of mobile photography.
In March 2012, Instagram was acquired by Facebook with 27 million users.
Personally, I had to open an Instagram account because my nieces asked me to open an Instagram account because they said "Facebook" is for the older generation.
